## General information

### Can I contribute?
Yes.
### In which ways can I do it?
Every help is appreciated. I'm not a pro developer, so every bug report,
commit and suggestion that might improve the mod is welcome.

## Using the source
Download the git repo. It should contain everything you need to start, but a
version of [Immersive Engineering](https://github.com/BluSunrize/ImmersiveEngineering).
You can download a suitable version from its official
[CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-engineering/files)
page and put it into the libraries folder ("*./libs*"). Then follow the instructions
of Forge to setup the workspace. Then you should have everything that you need to
start coding.
