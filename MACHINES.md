# Machines
There's a list of all the multiblock machines found in this mod.

They are configurable (see the configuration file for hints).

##Sawmill
Lets you spare wood logs: it can cut logs using his RF-powered saw and outputs
planks and woodchips. Later on you can burn woodchips in a furnace, use them as
biomass fuel for the generator or do something else (honestly idk what else).
##Biomass Generator
Did you think woodchips are useless? Hehe, *wrong*. This machine produces energy
by burning biomass. Drop the **Woodchips** in the top hatch of the machine ~~(hint:
conveyor belts)~~, then fill it with **Water** (by right clicking on the pressure
chamber access). Now just fire up (*literally*) the machine by using **Flint and
Steel** on the top hatch. Now it's up and running.

Keep it running, since once it's stopped you have to fire it up again.
The water isn't consumed (for now, maybe going to change).
The fuel obviously burns fast, so feed the beast quickly (it has an internal storage
of 128 Woodchips).
