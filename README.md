# Immersive Sawmills [WARNING: VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT VERSION]
**Immersive Sawmills** is an addon for
[Immersive Engineering](https://github.com/BluSunrize/ImmersiveEngineering)
which aims at making wood a better resource.

## Features
It offers more efficient ways to obtain planks from logs with the *Sawmill*, or a
way to produce power throgh a *Biomass Generator*, and so on.

A short description: [LONGER DESCRIPTION](./MACHINES.md)

* The Sawmill: a more resource efficient way to convert logs to planks. Outputs
woodchips too as it saws the wood. Needs energy to run.

~~* The Woodchipper: creates woodchips from logs or planks.~~ //TODO create it

* The Biomass Generator: burns woodchips to produce energy ~~(air pollution alert)~~.
Needs a flint&steel or some energy to start up, but the combustion continues until
the fuel runs out. Keep it running!
